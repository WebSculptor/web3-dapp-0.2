# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

```shell
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0xeD802ee96c58141D744865301A7145D882C4254D";
const SIMPLE_REGISTRY = "0x48F99db81f3f75E3a856D71bd38Afc745881eb00";
```
